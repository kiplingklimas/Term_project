In the fire-prone mixed conifer/aspen forests of the Intermountain West (IW) fuel reduction treatments including stand thinning, mastication, aspen promotion and prescribed fire are implemented to reduce the risk, incidence and/or extent of destructive, high severity wildfire. Due to the high value of forested resources in the IW and the risk of post-fire sediment transport or debris flows downstream from burned areas, fuel reduction treatments are important landscape-scale tools that forest managers use to protect forest assets. However, the complex and pyrophytic nature of IW forests, along environmental and societal constraints, lends to barriers against spatially targeted implementation of fuel reduction treatments in high-value forested watersheds (Larson &amp; Churchill, 2012). Modeling the effect of fuel reduction treatments on fire behavior in fire-prone forests of the western United States has shown that targeted fuel reduction treatments are more effective at altering fire behavior (i.e. rate of spread, flame length) than randomly or indiscriminately applied treatments (Kim et al., 2009; Minas et al., 2014; Prichard et al., 2020). The spatial distribution of treatments must then follow a prioritization hierarchy, such as concentrated, dispersed or regularly arranged treated areas within a forest (Kim et al., 2009), but the economic trade-off and efficacy of treatment distribution warrants greater examination in IW forests, where fuel treatments are applied to reduce the risk of high severity wildfire (Barros et al., 2019). By altering fire behavior through landscape-scale treatments, forest managers hope to reduce the extent of high-severity burned areas and mitigate downstream consequences of high-severity wildfire, such as the development of debris flows which can have negative impacts on high value assets such as reservoirs or fish habitat.

Figure 1: databse structure for forest and fuels inventory. This database structure is compatible with tree and stand level forest simulation software such as the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) which can be used to model forest structure over time. An advantage of this approach and structure is these data allow detailed simulation of mortality during fire. Tree level data are related to plot polygons that allow for stand-level simulation. Fuels data is required for modeled fire behavior, such as flame length, rate or spread or fire type (surface, passive or active). Whether or not these tables become populated remains to be seen- a disadvantage of this approach is that fuel reduction treatments are not readily applied to the landscape in question. It is also only useable for fire behavior modeling as an ArcMap toolbar extension.
