Forest strcuture, topographic, and environmental variables are needed to create a machine learning model training dataset.

Figure 1: databse structure for fire severity databse.

This database contains tables for fire behavior, risk, topographic, vegetation and structural variables extracted from spatially explicit raster data layers for use as a training dataset in RandomForest (RF) models. 

The tables are linked to the severity table by the foreign key 'severity_id' which keeps track of both forest and non-forest severity datapoints. This database structure also allows data visualization between forest and non-forest landcover in Utah.
