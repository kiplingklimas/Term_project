# Plot the regression line, the confidence intervals ribbon, and the raw points
# (hint: make sure you add the layers to the plot in the right order!) 
# Data and regression line should be in different colors for the two age classes.
# The ribbon should be light gray (use gray90). The legend should appear at the 
# bottom. Theme used: light. Axis labels, legend title, and plot title should
